## 📊 COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

Based on typical hackathons, you're competing against:

### Your Advantages ✅
- ✅ **Production-ready**: Many projects are just prototypes
- ✅ **Real problem**: You solve $127B fraud issue
- ✅ **Working demo**: Many can't deploy successfully
- ✅ **Great docs**: Most have minimal documentation
- ✅ **Test coverage**: 100% vs. typical 20-30%
- ✅ **Clear market**: 2.5B users vs. vague TAM
- ✅ **Bitcoin native**: Not a port from another chain

### Where Others Might Win
- ⚠️ **More features**: Some may have shinier UI
- ⚠️ **Team size**: Some may be larger teams
- ⚠️ **Marketing**: Some may have better pitch videos

**Bottom Line**: Your technical execution is top-tier. Focus on a great demo video and you're a strong contender.

---

## 🎥 DEMO VIDEO IS CRITICAL

**Why the video matters most**:
- Judges will watch video first (not read code)
- Video shows your communication skills
- Video demonstrates working product
- Video tells your story

**Video Quality > Code Quality** (for judging)

A mediocre project with a great video often beats a great project with a bad video.

**Your project is great. Make your video great too!** 🎬

### Video Tips
1. **Hook them in 10 seconds**: "$127 billion lost to fraud annually..."
2. **Show, don't tell**: Live demo > slides
3. **Be enthusiastic**: Your energy is contagious
4. **Keep it moving**: 5 minutes max
5. **Show your face**: Builds trust and connection
6. **End with clear CTA**: "Try it at [URL]"

---

## 🆘 IF YOU GET STUCK

### Video Issues
**Problem**: "I don't know what to say"
→ **Solution**: Use the word-for-word script in `HACKATHON_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`

**Problem**: "Video quality is bad"
→ **Solution**: Loom.com handles this automatically

**Problem**: "I'm nervous on camera"
→ **Solution**: Record screen only (without face), add voiceover

### Deployment Issues
**Problem**: "Vercel deploy failed"
→ **Solution**: Check `HACKATHON_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` Troubleshooting section

**Problem**: "Wallet won't connect on deployed site"
→ **Solution**: Check contract address in env vars matches deployed contract

### Submission Issues
**Problem**: "DoraHacks form is confusing"
→ **Solution**: All content is pre-written in `SUBMISSION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, just copy-paste

**Problem**: "I'm running out of time"
→ **Solution**: Prioritize in this order:
1. Video (required)
2. Deployment (can use localhost if desperate)
3. Polish (skip if needed)
