## üí° DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT

**Use this as your outline:**

### [0:00-0:30] Hook & Introduction
```
Hi! I'm [Your Name], and this is VoxCard - bringing Bitcoin to 2.5 billion 
people through community savings.

Did you know that 2.5 billion people worldwide rely on informal savings 
groups called Ajo, Esusu, or ROSCAs? These groups handle over $500 billion 
annually, but lose $127 billion to fraud and mismanagement.

VoxCard solves this by bringing these savings groups on-chain with Clarity 
smart contracts on Stacks, secured by Bitcoin.
```

### [0:30-1:15] Problem Statement
```
[Show slides/graphics]

Traditional savings groups have major problems:
- No transparency - cash-based record keeping
- No security - coordinators can steal funds
- No accountability - defaulters join new groups
- Geographic limits - must meet in person

People need these groups for financial inclusion, but the current system 
is broken.
```

### [1:15-3:45] Live Demo
```
[Screen recording]

Let me show you how VoxCard works:

1. [Connect Wallet] 
   "First, I'll connect my Leather wallet. VoxCard supports all Stacks 
   wallets like Leather and Xverse."

2. [Browse Plans]
   "Here I can see existing savings groups. Each shows the contribution 
   amount, frequency, and trust score required."

3. [Create Plan]
   "Let's create a new monthly savings group. I'll set it for 10 people, 
   1 STX per month, for 12 months. I can also set a minimum trust score 
   to ensure reliable members."

4. [Show Trust Score]
   "The trust score system prevents fraud. Complete your contributions 
   on time, your score increases. Miss payments, it decreases. This 
   creates on-chain reputation."

5. [Make Contribution]
   "Now I'll contribute to my plan. The smart contract tracks everything 
   on-chain, secured by Bitcoin through Stacks."

6. [Show Explorer]
   "And here's our transaction settling on Bitcoin. That's the power of 
   Stacks - we get Bitcoin's security with smart contract functionality."
```

### [3:45-4:15] Technical Highlights
```
[Show GitHub/Code]

VoxCard is production-ready:
- 37 out of 37 tests passing
- Written in Clarity, Stacks' secure-by-design language
- Modern React frontend with wallet integration
- Deployed and working on testnet

[Show test results quickly]
```

### [4:15-4:45] Bitcoin Alignment & Impact
```
This project directly increases Bitcoin utility. Instead of just holding 
Bitcoin, people can use it for everyday financial needs - saving together 
with their community.

We're bringing Bitcoin to 2.5 billion unbanked people, not through 
speculation, but through solving real problems they face every day.

VoxCard is ready for sBTC integration, so users can use real Bitcoin, not 
just synthetic assets.
```

### [4:45-5:00] Closing
```
Try the demo at [YOUR_URL]. The future of community finance is transparent, 
secure, and powered by Bitcoin.

Thank you!
